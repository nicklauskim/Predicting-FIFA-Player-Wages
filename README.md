# Predicting FIFA Player Wages Using Multiple Linear Regression


This is a data science project on FIFA player data. The project called for the application of linear regression knowledge and techniques to a dataset of professional football players from 2019 and the overall goal was to build and train a regression model to predict playersâ€™ wages. While constructing the model, I applied concepts such as imputing missing values, feature selection, transforming variables, creating new features, and more. I also had to address several potential issues in regression models, such as nonlinearity, nonconstant variance, violation of normality, multicollinearity, etc. This paper focuses mainly on applying statistical theory through R and details the process behind creating my eventual final model.
